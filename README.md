Matchers to test before, after and around hooks(currently supports gsymbol and object callbacks):
    
Symbol Callbacks:

    describe Post do
      it { should callback(:count_comments).before(:save) }
      it { should callback(:post_to_twitter).after(:create) }
      it { should callback(:evaluate_if_should_validate).before(:validation) }
      it { should callback(:add_some_convenience_accessors).after(:find) }
    end
    
    describe User do
      it { should_not callback(:make_email_validation_ready!).before(:validation).on(:update) }
      it { should callback(:make_email_validation_ready!).before(:validation).on(:create) }
      it { should callback(:update_user_count).before(:destroy) }
    end

Object Callbacks:

    class CallbackClass
      def before_save{}
      def after_create{}
      def before_validation{}
      def after_find{}
    end
    
    describe Post do
      it { should callback(CallbackClass).before(:save) }
      it { should callback(CallbackClass).after(:create) }
      it { should callback(CallbackClass).before(:validation) }
      it { should callback(CallbackClass).after(:find) }
    end
    
    describe User do
      it { should_not callback(CallbackClass).before(:validation).on(:update) }
      it { should callback(CallbackClass).before(:validation).on(:create) }
      it { should callback(CallbackClass).before(:destroy) }
    end

Be aware that this tests for the method call and not the method itself. It makes testing via triggering the callback events (validation, save) unnecessary, but you should still test the called procedure seperately.

In Rails 4 and Bundler, add the following to your Gemfile:

    group :test do
      gem "shoulda-callback-matchers", ">=0.3.0"
    end

In Rails 3 and Bundler, add version 0.0.2 to your Gemfile:

    group :test do
      gem "shoulda-callback-matchers", "=0.2.0"
    end

rspec-rails needs to be in the development group so that Rails generators work.

    group :development, :test do
      gem "rspec-rails"
    end

Shoulda will automatically include matchers into the appropriate example groups.
